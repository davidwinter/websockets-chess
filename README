Chess

This is an experiment to create a chess game using HTML 5 canvas and websockets.

You'll need node.js

To start the server, run:

	node server/main.js

Then open public/index.html in your browser. You'll get the waiting for oponent screen. Open a new tab, or get someone else to join, and then play.

The game only currently renders and communicates between clients. No chess rules are enforced.
